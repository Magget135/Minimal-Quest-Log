# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
# ## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
# ## backend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.py"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

Fixed critical date serialization issues for MongoDB compatibility. The backend is ready for frontend integration."
